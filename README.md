# Weight Shrinkage Tuning Bias

This repository contains the source code to the paper *Analyzing and Correcting Biased Machine Learning-Based Tuning of Weight Shrinkage in Forecast Combination*. 

The structure of the repository is as follows: The folder **Codes** contains all source codes for the data generation, the analytical results, the plots, regression tree and the evaluation results. The respective files are:

- General Functions and Settings
-> Functions and Settings used 
  
- Generation of Analytical Datasets
- Generation of Complete Analytical Dataset and Analytical Results
- Regression Tree Model
- Generation of Evaluation Datasets
- Generation of Complete Evaluation Dataset and Evaluation Results


The folder **Datasets** contains the generated synthetic datasets, with the subfolder **Analytical Datasets** containing the 140 datasets generated for the analytical part and **Evaluation Datasets** the 48 datasets generated for the evaluation of shrinkage correction.
